##  Student Course Management System

Welcome! This is a simple **Java console-based project** built to manage student registrations and their course enrollments. It’s designed to demonstrate core Java concepts like OOP, lists, object handling, and basic user interaction via console input.

# mostly focused on creating custom obj and understanding how is it being manipulated in different situations

# About the Project

The idea was to create a basic system where:
- Students can register with their roll number, name, and phone number
- They can view their details anytime
- And enroll in available courses like Java, Python, Web Development, etc.

Everything runs smoothly through the console using just Java — no database or external tools involved.

# What It Can Do

1 Register students  
2 Show student details  
3 List available courses  
4 Enroll students in courses  
5 Show enrolled courses per student  

All the courses are predefined, so users just pick one and go!

#  Tech Stack

- Java (Core)
- ArrayList for storing data
- OOP principles (classes, encapsulation, constructors, etc.)
- Simple Scanner for input

#  How to Run It

1. Clone the repo or download the `.java` files
2. Open the project in any Java IDE (IntelliJ / Eclipse / VS Code)
3. Run the `Main.java` file
4. Interact through the terminal and explore the features!

# Thinking of adding it next -- enhancment

- Add file storage using File I/O
- Add data persistence
- Prevent enrolling in the same course more than once
